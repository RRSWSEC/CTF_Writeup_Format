RRSW Season 2 DFIR Post-Play Writeup Template
1. Case Information

Case Name:
Challenge Name / ID:
Analyst Name / Handle:
Team Name (if applicable):
Date of Submission:

Environment Used:

OS
Tools
Versions
2. Executive Summary

Provide a high-level summary of the incident.

Your summary should clearly explain:

What type of incident occurred
What system or environment was affected
What the attacker attempted or achieved
How the situation was resolved

This section should be readable by a non-technical audience.

3. Scope and Objectives

Define the problem space.

What artifacts or environment were provided
What your task was as the analyst
What questions needed to be answered

Focus on understanding the intent of the investigation, not just the mechanics.

4. Initial Triage

Document your first interaction with the data.

What type of artifact(s) you received
How you validated or opened them
Initial structure or layout observations
Anything immediately unusual

Do not skip this section. Early observations often explain later findings.

5. Environment and Artifact Familiarization

This section is critical for Season 2.

Describe:

The structure of the environment or dataset
Key directories, files, or logical groupings
Any patterns in naming, organization, or formatting

You are expected to demonstrate that you understood the environment before acting on it.

6. Artifact Analysis

Break down your investigation by type.

6.1 File System Analysis
Notable files and directories
Suspicious naming conventions
Timestamp anomalies
Files that required further inspection
6.2 Content Analysis
Encoded or transformed data encountered
Methods used to interpret or decode content
Indicators of layered or staged information

Focus on process and reasoning, not just results.

6.3 Behavioral Indicators
Evidence of user or attacker activity
Signs of execution or interaction
Correlation between different artifacts
7. Timeline Reconstruction

Reconstruct events in order.

Time	Event	Source
		

Focus on:

Initial access or trigger event
Subsequent actions
Any gaps or inconsistencies
Final observable state

This is one of the most important sections.

8. Correlation and Linking

Season 2 expects this explicitly.

Describe how you connected separate pieces of evidence:

How one artifact led to another
How different data sources reinforced each other
How you avoided false assumptions

You are not just finding things. You are connecting them.

9. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

List all relevant indicators.

9.1 File-Based
Names
Hashes (if applicable)
9.2 Logical Indicators
Patterns
Strings
Identifiers
9.3 Behavioral Indicators
Actions inferred from evidence
10. Attack Analysis

Explain what happened from the attacker’s perspective.

Entry point (if identifiable)
Actions taken
Methods used
Level of sophistication

Do not assume. Base conclusions only on evidence.

11. Methodology

Explain how you approached the problem.

Tools used and why
Workflow
Key pivots in your investigation
Dead ends and how you corrected course

This section matters more than the final answer.

12. Findings and Conclusions

Summarize the investigation.

What actually happened
What evidence supports it
Any uncertainties
Overall confidence level
13. Flag(s)

Provide all discovered flags.

RRSW{...}

For each flag:

Where it was found
How it was derived
What it represents
14. Lessons Learned

Reflect on the process.

What you learned
What slowed you down
What you would do differently
Skills improved or needed
15. Appendix

Optional, but encouraged.

15.1 Decoding or Analysis Steps
15.2 Commands or Queries Used
15.3 Raw Outputs
15.4 Supporting Notes
Season 2 Guidance (Read Before Submitting)

This challenge is not about speed. It is about analysis discipline.

Do not jump straight to decoding everything
Understand the structure before interacting with it
Treat artifacts as part of a narrative, not isolated puzzles
Assume everything is there for a reason
Avoid brute force unless justified

You are expected to demonstrate:

Observation
Correlation
Reasoning
Restraint
Reviewer Expectations

Submissions are evaluated based on:

Clarity of thought
Evidence-based conclusions
Quality of reconstruction
Depth of analysis
Ability to explain decisions

Not just correctness.

HOWEVER; at the end of the day....This is a game.  Have fun! Just play, discover, and enjoy yourself.  Welcome to my home.
